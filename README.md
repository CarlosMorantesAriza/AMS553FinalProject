# AMS553FinalProject

Forests are an important source of biodiversity and economic resources globally. An important question is to determine how to harvest trees sustainably while also conserving biodiversity. Forest systems are difficult to study empirically because they operate on large spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, to address this question, simulation modeling is an ideal tool. For this project, we propose two simulate a simplified forest with 5 species without any harvesting, and then calculate biodiversity metrics. Then, we propose to simulate the same forest testing different proportions and sizes of trees harvested, and calculate the same biodiversity metrics. This will allow us to make sustainable logging recommendations. 

## The model

$$N_{TOT_{t+1}}= \sum_{i} r_{i} N_{i_{t}} (1-\frac{\sum_{i} N_{i_{t}}}{K}) - \sum_{i}h_{i}N_{i_{t}}$$
